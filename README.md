Swift on Sundays is a regular YouTube livestream series from [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws). In each episode we’ll build a new app from scratch, look into an interesting Swift technique, or tackle other interesting challenges, but always using lots of live coding.

If you haven’t already watched the episodes, [you should subscribe to Paul’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/paulhudson) and start there. If you set YouTube to alert you when new content is posted, you should get a reminder when the next livestream starts. Failing that, follow Paul on Twitter at [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws) to get reminders there.

This GitHub repository stores the completed code we built each week, so you can try it out, or compare your version against the originals. Unless otherwise noted, all code in this repository is free to use however you want, commercially or otherwise, with no need to provide any credit to Paul.

**Important note:** Projects that use Vapor do *not* ship with their Vapor dependencies or Xcode project – you should run `vapor build` and/or `vapor xcode` locally to get the latest versions of the Vapor dependencies.
